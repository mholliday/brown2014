29june2015:
In the brown2014/chapter5 directory I created the ch5_v3 directory
for the third version of the meadowlarks site described in chapter
5 of brown2014. This is the version on pages 48-52 of brown2014 which involve using jshint for lint checking, linkchecker for checking links, and grunt for toolchain automation. 
I started with a recursive cp of the ch5_v2 directory.

I. Lint Checking

a) In the site directory install jshint by

npm install --save-dev jshint

b) In the site directory do

jshint meadowlark.js

and there will be no output since jshint does not detect any problems with meadowlark.js.

c) To illustrate a jshint complaint add the line

if (app.thing == null) console.log('bleat!');

to meadowlark.js and rerun jshint. There will be a warning about
using ``=='' instead of ``===''. Now remove that line.

II. Link Checking

a) The program linkchecker needs to be installed the system administrator. The download is at

http://wummel.github.io/linkchecker/

b) Assuming that the system administrator has installed linkchecker, in one shell go to the site directory and start the node server with

node meadowlark.js

and in another shell execute the command

linkchecker http://localhost:3000

III. Toolchain Automation Using Grunt

a) Install the packages for the grunt command line (that is, cli)
and grunt itself using (in the site directory)

npm install --save-dev grunt-cli
npm install --save-dev grunt

Note the grunt-cli install is different from the brown2014 and I
did not need to use sudo probably since I am just doing a install
in the local node project.

b) Install the npm packages that are grunt plugins while in the
site directory.

npm install --save-dev grunt-cafe-mocha
npm install --save-dev grunt-contrib-jshint
npm install --save-dev grunt-exec

c) Create a file in the site directory named Gruntfile.js. See
page 50 of brown2014 for the code. I had to make a few changes

i) in the configuration information for cafemocha I changed `qa/tests-*.js' to `qa/tests-unit.js' since zombie is not working.
ii) in the load plugin array near the top I remove the comma after
`grunt-exec'. I did not remove the comma after the jshint initConfig
info though I do not see why it is there.

d) I created a second shell and cd'ed to the site directory and ran the command

node meadowlark.js

to start the node server running.

e) In the first shell in the site directory I ran the command

grunt

to cause grunt to execute all the tasks in the specified toolchain.
