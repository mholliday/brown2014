21june2015:
In the brown2014/chapter3 directory I created the ch3_v4 directory
for the fourth version of the meadowlarks site described in chapter
3 of brown2014. This is the version starting on the bottom of page
26 (with static files) and going through page 28 (dynamic views) of
brown2014.
I did this by a recursive cp of the ch3_v3 directory.

I then reran 

npm init

to create the new version of the package.json file.

Version 4 involves 

I. Static Files
a) In the project directory, site, I created a directory named public.

b) Edit meadowlark.js to put a line declaring the middleware named
static before the routes. This middleware allows static files to be
accessed by file pathnames in the url; that is, like files in the
original static web sites.

c) In the directory site/public create a subdirectory named img to
hold static image files. Put in the img subdirectory the file logo.png.

d) Edit the file site/views/layout/main.handlebars to add in some 
html to reference the static image file, logo.png.

II. Dynamic Views
a) Edit the file site/meadowlarks.js to add an array declaration for
a variable named fortunes. The code in the book has a typographical error. 
After the last element of the array there
is not supposed to be a comma. If the comma is there, then the
About page will not display correctly.

b) Edit the file site/views/about.handlebars to include the html to
display a fortune using the {{fortune}} notation to insert a passed value
dynamically into the html.

<h1>About Meadowlark Travel</h1>

<p>Your fortune for the day:</p>
<blockquote>{{fortune}}</blockquote>

c) Further edit the file site/meadowlarks.js by modifying the route
function for /about to include randomly picking a string from the fortunes
array and assigning it to the variable named randomFortune.

app.get('/about', function(req, res) {
  res.render('about', function(req, res) {
    var randomFortune =
      fortunes[Math.floor(Math.random() * fortunes.length)];
    res.render('about', { fortune: randomFortune });
  });
});

This code introduces a key concept which is the 

{fortune: randomFortune} 

which passes a javascript object to the view /about which has one key-value
pair. The key of that pair, fortune, identifies {{fortune}} in the view
and causes the value of that key-value pair (which is the value of the variable
randomFortune) to replace {{fortune}} in the view. So this is what makes 
template files, template files; the template placeholder gets replaced by the 
value passed upon the res.render function call.

d) Restart the server by doing

node meadowlarks.js

in the site directory and in the iceweasel browser go to localhost:3000
and then you will see home page include the logo.png icon. Then go
to localhost:3000/about in the iceweasel browser and you will see a 
randomly picked fortune appear.
