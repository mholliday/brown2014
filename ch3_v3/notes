19june2015:
In the brown2014/chapter3 directory I created the ch3_v3 directory
for the third version of the meadowlarks site described in chapter
3 of brown2014. This version is covered on pages 24-most of 26
of brown2014.

I did this by a recursive cp of the ch3_v3 directory
and deleting the package.json file and the node_modules directory.

I then reran 

npm init
npm install --save express

to create the new version of the package.json file and the 
node_modules directory. 

Or do

npm install -g express

once for all version.

Version 3 involves 

a) installing the express3-handlebars package using

npm install --save express3-handlebars

command. This is a templating framework and is not the default one
that is jade.

b) add to meadowlark.js some lines near the top for making handlebars
the view engine.

c) creating a directory named views in the site directory and creating a 
directory named layouts in the views directory.

d) in the layouts directory creating a main.handlebars file which is a 
template and contains {{{body}}} which will be replaced with the HTML for
each view. Note that three braces are needed on each side to force the HTML
to be interpreted as HTML.

e) created the files in the view directory each of which is one view page
representing one page in the website. The files are

views/home.handlebars
views/about.handlebars
views.404.handlebars
views/500.handlebars

f) modify the route functions in meadowlarks.js for '/' and '/about' and
modify the middleware functions in meadowlarks.js for 404 and 500.

g) I then tested it in the browser as I did the earlier versions.
