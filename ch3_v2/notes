18june2015:
In the brown2014/chapter3 directory I created the ch3_v2 directory
for the second version of the meadowlarks site described in chapter
3 of brown2014. This is the version covered on pages 22 and 23 of
brown2014. I did this by a recursive cp of the ch3_v1
 directoryand deleting the package.json file and the node_modules directory.

I then reran 

npm init
npm install --save express

to create the new version of the package.json file and the 
node_modules directory. 

a) Version 2 is simply adding two route functions to the 
meadowlark.js file and adding one parameter to the 404 function
in the meadowlark.js file. 

b) I then tested it in the browser as I did in version 1. I used
the urls

localhost:3000
localhost:3000/
localhost:3000/about

and received the expected responses.
